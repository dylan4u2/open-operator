# Anthropic Computer Use

Claude AI's computer use capability, [officially announced by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use), allows the AI to interact with computer interfaces in a manner similar to humans. The capability is integrated into Claude 3.5 Sonnet and enables direct interaction with graphical user interfaces through visual understanding and cursor control. Key features include:

1. Cursor movement: Claude can move a cursor around a computer screen[^3][^10].

2. Clicking: The AI can click on relevant locations on the screen[^3][^10].

3. Text input: Claude can input information using a virtual keyboard[^10].

4. Screen analysis: The AI can analyze the computer screen to understand the interface[^3].

5. Tool and software use: Claude can utilize various standard tools and software programs[^3].

6. Task automation: The capability aims to automate complex tasks by emulating human computer interactions[^3].

7. API integration: Anthropic has built an API that allows Claude to perceive and interact with computer interfaces[^11].

8. Performance: On the OSWorld evaluation, which tests AI models' ability to use computers like humans, Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored 14.9% in the screenshot-only category, significantly higher than the next-best AI system's score of 7.8%[^10][^11].

9. Limitations: The tool is still in its early stages, with challenges in actions like scrolling, dragging, and zooming[^3].

10. Availability: As of January 2025, this feature is available in public beta and is tied to Anthropic's Claude 3.5 model[^3][^10].

It's important to note that while this capability represents a significant advancement in AI, it is still far from human-level skill in computer use[^10].
